This repository is a compilation of smaller projects that have been used as part of a larger project

## Flask

Flask is a lightweight and popular web framework for Python. It was created by Armin Ronacher and is distributed as an open-source software under the BSD license. Flask is designed to be simple and flexible, making it a popular choice for building web applications.

### Getting Started

To get started with Flask, you'll first need to install it using pip, the package installer for Python. You can do this by running the following command:

```clt
pip install flask
```

### Features

Flask is known for its simplicity and flexibility, which make it a great choice for a wide range of web applications. Some of its key features include:

- Lightweight and easy to learn
- Built-in development server and debugger
- Support for HTTP requests and responses
- Templating engine for rendering dynamic content
- Extensible through a wide range of third-party extensions

## Websockets

WebSockets is a protocol that enables bidirectional communication between clients and servers. It is designed to be used over HTTP, and can be used to build real-time web applications such as chat systems, multiplayer games, and collaborative editing tools.

### Getting started

To get started with websockets, you'll first need to install it using pip, the package installer for Python. You can do this by running the following command:
```
pip install websockets
```

### Features

WebSockets offers a number of benefits over other communication protocols, such as long polling and server-sent events:

1. Real-time communication: WebSockets enables real-time communication between clients and servers, allowing for more interactive and responsive web applications.
2. Lower latency: Because the connection is persistent, there is no need to set up a new connection for each message. This reduces the latency of the communication.
3. Bidirectional communication: WebSockets allows for bidirectional communication, meaning that both the client and the server can send messages to each other.
4. Efficient use of resources: WebSockets reduces the amount of overhead associated with setting up and tearing down connections, which can lead to more efficient use of server resources.

## YoloV8

YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is a real-time object detection system that uses deep learning to identify and track objects in video streams or images. It is the latest version of the popular YOLO family of object detection models.

### Getting started

To get started with Yolov8, you'll first need to install it using pip, the package installer for Python. You can do this by running the following command:

``` clt
pip install ultralytics
```

### Features

YOLOv8 offers a number of benefits over other object detection systems, such as Faster R-CNN and SSD:

- Real-time performance: YOLOv8 is designed for real-time object detection, which means it can detect objects in video streams or images as they are being captured.
- High accuracy: YOLOv8 achieves high accuracy on object detection tasks, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
- Flexibility: YOLOv8 can be trained on a wide range of object classes and can be used in a variety of applications, from surveillance to self-driving cars.
- Open source: YOLOv8 is an open source project, which means that it is freely available for anyone to use and modify.

## Next.js

This is a sample Next.js project that demonstrates how to build server-rendered React applications with Next.js.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= v14.17.0)
- npm (>= v7.19.0)

#### Creating a new project

1. Create a new file by running: 

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

2. cd into the create file:

```
cd my-app
```

3. Run the development server on your local

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server with hot module replacement (HMR), allowing you to see changes in real-time as you make edits to your code. The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

### Production Build

To build the Next.js application for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready build of your Next.js application in the .next directory.

### Production Deployment

To run the Next.js application in production mode, after building, run:

```
npm run start
```

This will start the application in production mode using the built files in the .next directory.

### Customize

You can customize the Next.js application by modifying the source code in the pages directory. Next.js follows a file-based routing approach, where each file in the pages directory represents a route in the application.

You can also customize the styles by modifying the CSS files in the styles directory, or by using CSS-in-JS solutions like Styled-components or Emotion.
